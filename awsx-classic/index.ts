// @pulumi/awsx is a deployment-only module.  If someone tries to capture it, and we fail for some
// reason we want to give a good message about what the problem likely is.  Note that capturing a
// deployment time module can be ok in some cases.  For example, using "awsx.apigateway.authorizerResponse"
// as a helper function is fine. However, in general, the majority of this API is not safe to use
// at 'run time' and will fail.
