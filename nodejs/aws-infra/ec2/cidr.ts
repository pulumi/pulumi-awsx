// For IPv4, CIDR notation is an alternative to the older system of representing networks by their
// starting address and the subnet mask, both written in dot-decimal notation. 192.168.100.0/24
// equivalent to 192.168.100.0/255.255.255.0.
//
// The number of addresses of a subnet may be calculated as 2^(address length − prefix length),
// where address length is 128 for IPv6 and 32 for IPv4. For example, in IPv4, the prefix length /29
// gives: 2^(32 − 29) = 2^3 = 8 addresses.

// CIDR is principally a bitwise, prefix-based standard for the representation of IP addresses and
// their routing properties. It facilitates routing by allowing blocks of addresses to be grouped
// into single routing table entries. These groups, commonly called CIDR blocks, share an initial
// sequence of bits in the binary representation of their IP addresses. IPv4 CIDR blocks are
// identified using a syntax similar to that of IPv4 addresses: a dotted-decimal address, followed
// by a slash, then a number from 0 to 32, i.e., a.b.c.d/n. The dotted decimal portion is the IPv4
// address. The number following the slash is the prefix length, the number of shared initial bits,
// counting from the most-significant bit of the address. When emphasizing only the size of a
// network, the address portion of the notation is usually omitted. Thus, a /20 block is a CIDR
// block with an unspecified 20-bit prefix.

// An IP address is part of a CIDR block, and is said to match the CIDR prefix if the initial n bits
// of the address and the CIDR prefix are the same. An IPv4 address is 32 bits so an n-bit CIDR
// prefix leaves 32 − n bits unmatched, meaning that 232 − n IPv4 addresses match a given n-bit CIDR
// prefix. Shorter CIDR prefixes match more addresses, while longer prefixes match fewer. An address
// can match multiple CIDR prefixes of different lengths.
