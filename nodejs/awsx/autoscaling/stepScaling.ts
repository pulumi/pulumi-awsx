/**
 * Step scaling policies increase or decrease the current capacity of your Auto Scaling group based
 * on a set of scaling adjustments, known as step adjustments. The adjustments vary based on the
 * size of the alarm breach.
 *
 * For example, consider the following StepScaling description for an ASG that has both a current
 * capacity and a desired capacity of 10. The current and desired capacity is maintained while the
 * aggregated metric value is greater than 40 and less than 60.
 *
 * ```ts
 *  const policy = {
 *      // ... other values
 *      adjustmentType: "PercentChangeInCapacity",
 *      steps: {
 *          upper: [{ value: 60, adjustment: 10 }, { value: 70, adjustment: 30 }],
 *          lower: [{ value: 40, adjustment: -10 }, { value: 30, adjustment: -30 }]
 *      },
 *  };
 * ```
 *
 * If the metric value gets to 60, Application Auto Scaling increases the desired capacity of the
 * group by 1, to 11. That's based on the second step adjustment of the scale-out policy (add 10
 * percent of 10). After the new capacity is added, Application Auto Scaling increases the current
 * capacity to 11. If the metric value rises to 70 even after this increase in capacity, Application
 * Auto Scaling increases the target capacity by 3, to 14. That's based on the third step adjustment
 * of the scale-out policy (add 30 percent of 11, 3.3, rounded down to 3).
 *
 * If the metric value gets to 40, Application Auto Scaling decreases the target capacity by 1, to
 * 13, based on the second step adjustment of the scale-in policy (remove 10 percent of 14, 1.4,
 * rounded down to 1). If the metric value falls to 30 even after this decrease in capacity,
 * Application Auto Scaling decreases the target capacity by 3, to 10, based on the third step
 * adjustment of the scale-in policy (remove 30 percent of 13, 3.9, rounded down to 3).
