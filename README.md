## Pulumi AWS Infrastructure Components

Pulumi's framework for Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure.

To use this package, [install the Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/). For a streamlined Pulumi walkthrough, including language runtime installation and AWS configuration, see the [Crosswalk for AWS documentation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/crosswalk/aws/).

The AWS Infrastructure package is intended to provide [component](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/resources/components/) wrappers around many core AWS 'raw' resources to make them easier and more convenient to use.  In general, the `@pulumi/awsx` package mirrors the module structure of `@pulumi/aws` (i.e. `@pulumi/awsx/ecs` or `@pulumi/awsx/ec2`).  These [components](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/resources/components/) are designed to take care of much of the redundancy and boilerplate necessary when using the raw AWS resources, while still striving to expose all underlying functionality if needed.

The AWS Infrastructure package undergoes constant improvements and additions.  While we will strive to maintain backward compatability here, we will occasionally make breaks here as appropriate if it helps improve the overall quality of this package.

The AWS Infrastructure package exposes many high level abstractions.  Including:

* [`ec2`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-awsx/blob/master/awsx/ec2).  A module that makes it easier to work with your AWS network, subnets, and security groups.  By default, the resources in the package follow the [AWS Best Practices](
  https://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/aws-single-vpc-design/), but can be configured as desired in whatever ways you want.  Most commonly, this package is used to acquire the default Vpc for a region (using `awsx.ec2.DefaultNetwork`).  However, it can also be used to easily create or augment an existing Vpc.

* [`ecs`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-awsx/blob/master/awsx/ecs).  A module that makes it easy to create and configure clusters, tasks and services for running containers. Convenience resources are created to make the common tasks of creating EC2 or Fargate services and tasks much simpler.

* [`lb`](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-awsx/tree/master/awsx/lb).  A module for simply setting up [Elastic Load Balancing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/). This module provides convenient ways to set up either `Network` or `Application` load balancers, along with the appropriate ELB Target Groups and Listeners in order to have a high availability, automatically-scaled service.  These ELB components also work well with the other awsx components.  For example, an `lb.defaultTarget` can be passed in directly as the `portMapping` target of an `ecs.FargateService`.

The library also exposes the classic AWSx (the previous TypeScript) implementation. You can find these modules in the `classic` namespace. These modules include:

* `apigateway`
* `autoscaling`
* `ecs`
* `ec2`
* `cloudwatch`
* `lb`
* `cloudtrail`

### Installing

This package is available in many languages in the standard packaging formats.

### Node.js (Java/TypeScript)

To use from JavaScript or TypeScript in Node.js, install using either `npm`:

    npm install @pulumi/awsx

or `yarn`:

    yarn add @pulumi/awsx

### Python

To use from Python, install using `pip`:

    pip install pulumi_awsx

### Go

To use from Go, use `go get` to grab the latest version of the library

    go get github.com/pulumi/pulumi-awsx/sdk

### .NET

To use from .NET, install using `dotnet add package`:

    dotnet add package Pulumi.Awsx

### Configuration

The configuration options available for this provider  mirror those of the [Pulumi AWS Classic Provider](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-aws#configuration)
